# /executetask Command

Executes a task strictly following its task file.

## Trigger

User message starts with `/executetask` followed by task name.

## Execution Steps

1. **Locate and read the task file**
   - Find task in `docs/phases/`
   - Verify status is `defined`

2. **Invoke `roadmap-context` skill**
   - Gather current roadmap context

3. **Invoke `context-gathering` skill**
   - Read files specified in task's Context section

4. **Invoke `dependency-check` skill**
   - Verify ALL dependencies are `executed`
   - HALT if any dependency is not satisfied

5. **Pre-execution check**
   - List EVERY file that will be created, modified, or deleted
   - Present list to user
   - Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding

6. **Create git branch**
   - Branch name: task name (hyphenated)
   - Example: `01-setup-database`

7. **Execute the task**
   - Follow the To Do checklist exactly
   - Follow the Execution Plan exactly
   - Do NOT perform any action not in the task file

8. **Monitor boundaries**
   - If any boundary would be violated, HALT immediately
   - Surface the issue to user

## Rules

- NEVER execute without dependency check passing
- NEVER execute without user confirmation of file changes
- NEVER modify files not listed in the task
- NEVER perform actions outside the execution plan
- HALT immediately if boundaries would be violated
- ALWAYS create a dedicated branch for the task
