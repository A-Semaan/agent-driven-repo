# /committask Command

Updates task status to `executed`, commits changes, and returns to parent branch.

## Trigger

User message starts with `/committask`.

## Execution Steps

1. **Invoke `documentation-sync` skill**
   - Review all files touched during task
   - Ensure documentation is up to date
   - Create stubs for undocumented behavior

2. **Update task file**
   - Change `Status` from `defined` to `executed`
   - This is the ONLY change to the task file

3. **Commit all changes**
   - Stage all modified files
   - Commit message format: `task: [task-name] (GUID)`
   - Example: `task: 01-setup-database (a1b2c3d4-...)`

4. **Switch to parent branch**
   - Return to the branch from which the task branch was created
   - Typically `main` or a feature branch

## Commit Message Format

```
task: [task-name] ([GUID])

[Brief summary of what was accomplished]

Files changed:
- [list of files]
```

## Rules

- NEVER commit without running documentation-sync
- NEVER commit if documentation is out of sync
- NEVER modify task file content other than status
- ALWAYS include GUID in commit message
- ALWAYS return to parent branch after commit
